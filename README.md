# team_selector
This project uses the random module to form 2 teams with randomly selected members. The list data type is used to store the member's names.
The random mudule then shuffles through the list. Loops are used to iterate through the list and display the team members. Lastly, an if statement is used asking the users if they would like to reselect their teams again.
